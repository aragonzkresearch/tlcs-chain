# TLCS

This repo contains node software for running a Blockchain which provides a Time Lock Cryptography Service.

NOTE: This is a WIP, e.g. it does not contain the necessary CLI commands and REST endpoints to interact with
the TLCS parts of the chain!

# Getting Started

TLCS uses the [tendermint-abci](https://crates.io/crates/tendermint-abci) crate to communicate with a Tendermint instance which runs as a separate process. This means that to run a full node, Tendermint must be installed and run separately (see instructions below).

## Requirements

**Rust compiler**

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.67.1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

**Tendermint**

To install Tendermint, clone the [Tendermint repo](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) checkout v0.34.21 then follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.21/docs/introduction/install.md).

**libclang**

This is needed by the rocks db crate, run `sudo apt install libclang-dev build-essential`.

## Running a local chain

1. Clone this repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/tlcs-chain
cd tlcs-chain
```

2. Initialize a new chain:

```console
make init
```

3. Build and start the application:

```console
make run
```

The application will listen for connections on tcp://127.0.0.1:26658.

4. From a different terminal window start Tendermint:

```console
make tendermint-start
```

Tendermint will connect to the application and bind it's RPC server to 127.0.0.1:26657.

The chain (consisting of one node) is now up and running.


## Querying the chain

So far we've been running tlcs indirectly using make commnds and the rust build tool, Cargo. In the next
section we'll install tlcs and use it to query the chain (just like cosmos-sdk chains the tlcs binary serves as a
node and client).

1. Install tlcs:

```console
make install
```

2. Query a balance:

```console
tlcs query bank balances cosmos1syavy2npfyt9tcncdtsdzf7kny9lh777pahuux
```

Which returns:

```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "denom": "uatom",
      "amount": "34"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": null
}
```

The balance of this address was set to 34 in the genesis file.

3. Import the key corresponding to the above address into the tlcs key store:

```console
echo "race draft rival universe maid cheese steel logic crowd fork comic easy truth drift tomorrow eye buddy head time cash swing swift midnight borrow" | tlcs keys add alice
```

4. Send tokens:

```console
tlcs tx bank send alice cosmos180tr8wmsk8ugt32yynj8efqwg3yglmpwp22rut 10uatom --fee 1uatom
```

5. Query the address balance and observe that it has decreased by 11uatom which is the sum of the amount transferred and the fee:

```console
tlcs query bank balances cosmos1syavy2npfyt9tcncdtsdzf7kny9lh777pahuux
```

Which returns:

```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "denom": "uatom",
      "amount": "23"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": null
}

```
